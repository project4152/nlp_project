@Uber very upset. Making passenger travel 3km in opposite direction of destination, into rush hour downtown for pool pickup? Unacceptable.
@Uber_Support also what is the pick up distance for Pools? 3km in the opposite direction for destination is ridiculous.
@Uber_Support pooling needs to consider traffic along with proximity. Now 30min later to my destination despite being original passenger.

My best friend has been away for the whole month and it feels like when your pet runs out and doesn't comeback because it's been so long 😔😭
Literally the last 3 weeks in a row I've slept through my alarms for my inventory shift each morning 😂
When you're a little tempted to get a Gravel jersey but you don't want to neglect Fucale after 4 years of attachment that still continues 😂🤔
Discovering your best friend also wants to pursue the same career as you &amp; wants to take a second year off too is an incredible feeling ❤
Tonight I was originally off at 9 but stayed later to close. My mom never texted me asking why I never came home... cool 😂

@letsgoduke interesting simile. I'm not sure what you mean, but I'll be sure to keep one hand on the verb when I decide to invest
@letsgoduke doesn't sound so bad - coming from someone who has just spent the past 48 hours down one
@letsgoduke Massive. Have been curious about experimenting with Serum lately though
@letsgoduke I produce almost exclusively in Ableton. I use PT and Logic when school requires it. 140 ltrs isn't enough to talk plugins
@letsgoduke that's a broad question haha
@letsgoduke I think I need to start spending dedicated time to sound design instead of trying to do it as I write.
@letsgoduke yeah actually. Not right for this project though. They've gone into the "archive". lol
@letsgoduke I know what you mean kind of...these just didn't "sound" like me. I feel like I'm 10 again and only know 6 chords on guitar.
Times like these make me wonder how I ever finished a song before.
...everything sounded tired or generic. I'm going crazy.
I must have written maybe 30-40 different chord progressions in the past 2 days...

@MatthewHalliday @WayeMason there are also plenty of residential streets with needless gaps between buildings. Fill those in.
@MatthewHalliday @WayeMason but on the balance you're right - if we only allow density in a couple pockets we need massive towers.
@MatthewHalliday @WayeMason I'm slightly more optimistic that we can preserve heritage &amp; go 3-6 storeys even in residential areas over time

@SeanPlans yes, they will benefit at least in short/medium term, rest of us pay dearly for it.
@SmoggyRandall @globeandmail basically, home prices are lower in the suburbs and some people think that means it's cheaper.
@SmoggyRandall @globeandmail it does if you externalize infrastructure costs and ignore increased commuting costs.
@KTBrushett @EmmMacfarlane it's a good thing! We just need larger schools to do it...
@brewnoser that's the topic of all my subsequent tweets. $4m/year &amp; no new tax revenue. Genius policy.

@SeanPlans gain the revenue to maintain the interchange. So everybody loses. 2/2
@SeanPlans yeah, but the broader point is that 1) the municipality won't gain the revenue to pay for their services 2) province won't 1/2
@SeanPlans Nova Scotia is not growing, so we're adding a roughly $4m/year tax liability for zero net new revenue 2/2
@SeanPlans yeah - that Lantz interchange, if 5x more developments open than planned, will still cost more than the tax revenue EXCEPT 1/2
@SeanPlans thankfully
@SackvilleRivers @SeanPlans in Lantz that won't even cover their share of the interchange, let alone residential infrastructure
@SeanPlans properly accounting for the cost of sprawl through CCCs is one way of coming to grips with affordability.
